INSTRUCTIONS: Create Custom Metadata Record Manually
========================================

Since automated deployment is failing, please follow these steps to manually create the Custom Metadata record in Salesforce:

**Step 1: Navigate to Custom Metadata Types**
1. Go to Setup in Salesforce
2. In the Quick Find box, search for "Custom Metadata Types"
3. Click on "Custom Metadata Types"

**Step 2: Find Lead Assignment Config NXDS**
4. Find "Lead Assignment Config NXDS" in the list
5. Click on "Manage Records"

**Step 3: Create New Record**
6. Click "New"
7. Fill in the following values:
   - Label: NXDS Default
   - Lead Assignment Config NXDS Name: NXDS_Default
   - Active: ☑ (checked)
   - Batch Size: 10000
   - Lead Status: New
   - Pre Deal Status: NEW LEAD
   - Round Robin Type: Regular
   - Sales Office: Next day Settlement

8. Click "Save"

**Step 4: Verify Configuration**
9. Run this query in Developer Console to verify:
   SELECT DeveloperName, Active__c, Sales_Office__c, Lead_Status__c,
          Pre_Deal_Status__c, Round_Robin_Type__c, Batch_Size__c
   FROM Lead_Assignment_Config_NXDS__mdt

**Step 5: Start the Scheduler**
10. After creating the record, run this in Anonymous Apex:
    ScheduledLeadReassignmentNXDS.startAutoSchedule();

ALTERNATIVE: If you prefer, I can provide a package.xml for deployment
